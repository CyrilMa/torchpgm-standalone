## TorchPGM standalone

This is a very early version of a module to handle RBM-like models with PyTorch (including training on GPU)
For now only the functions essential for a basic RBM are made to work and the documentation is incomplete

Please refer to the `tutorial.ipynb` notebook to have an overview 

Before using :
- Change the `ROOT` variable in `config.py`
- Install required libraries
- Install [MMSEQS2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2)
