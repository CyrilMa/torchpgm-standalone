## TorchPGM standalone

This is a very early version of a module to handle RBM-like models with PyTorch (including training on GPU)
For now only the functions essential for a basic RBM are made to work and the documentation is incomplete

Please refer to the `tutorial.ipynb` notebook to have an overview
